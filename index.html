                    <p><strong>Erwin Smith</strong> (エルヴィン・スミス Eruvin Sumisu?) was the 13th commander (団長 Danchō?) of the Survey Corps. Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Erwin had a commanding presence, standing tall above most members of the Survey Corps, and had a quite muscular build with his blond hair kept neatly parted on the left side. He always wore a calm and collected expression on his face, with his icy blue eyes being one of his most striking features. His eyebrows were also quite noticeable, being very thick and bushy.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>Erwin typically dressed in the standard military uniform, donning the Survey Corps' signature green cape when on missions. He also wore a small, emerald bolo tie around his neck similar to the other military commanders, Nile Dok and Dot Pixis.</p>

                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a child, Erwin was a curious and insightful individual who did not accept facts at face value. He asked why humanity had no memory of what happened before they lived within the Walls.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>His father shared a theory with him that the king had altered humanity's memories.Too innocent to realize why his father would not discuss this with others, Erwin shared it with the other kids in town, which resulted in his father's "accidental" death, arranged by the Military Police Brigade's First Interior Squad.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Erwin later enlisted in the Training Corps. After graduating, Erwin joined the Survey Corps, where he stopped sharing his theory with others.</p>

                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>While a Squad Leader, Erwin devised the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation as a way to minimize casualties while on expeditions. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While leading the 49th Exterior Scouting Mission, Erwin is confronted by Hange Zoë, who demands that they be allowed to capture Titans to use as test subjects. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Erwin leads the 57th expedition out of Calaneth District on a mission to reach Shiganshina District and potentially uncover the secret of Eren's basement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the mission to retake Wall Maria, Scouts face the ultimate enemy in the face of beast titan.Standing before the panicked recruits, Erwin announces their plan to charge head-on against the Beast Titan using smoke signals as cover while Levi moves in from the side to confront him, using the line of Titans as a means of clearing the distance, leading to the heroic demise of the great leader.</p>
