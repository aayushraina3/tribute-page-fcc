                <p><strong>Erwin Smith</strong> (エルヴィン・スミス Eruvin Sumisu?) was the 13th commander (団長 Danchō?) of the Survey Corps. Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Erwin had a commanding presence, standing tall above most members of the Survey Corps, and had a quite muscular build with his blond hair kept neatly parted on the left side. He always wore a calm and collected expression on his face, with his icy blue eyes being one of his most striking features. His eyebrows were also quite noticeable, being very thick and bushy.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>Erwin typically dressed in the standard military uniform, donning the Survey Corps' signature green cape when on missions. He also wore a small, emerald bolo tie around his neck similar to the other military commanders, Nile Dok and Dot Pixis.</p>

                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As a child, Erwin was a curious and insightful individual who did not accept facts at face value. He asked why humanity had no memory of what happened before they lived within the Walls.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>His father shared a theory with him that the king had altered humanity's memories.Too innocent to realize why his father would not discuss this with others, Erwin shared it with the other kids in town, which resulted in his father's "accidental" death, arranged by the Military Police Brigade's First Interior Squad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Erwin later enlisted in the Training Corps. After graduating, Erwin joined the Survey Corps, where he stopped sharing his theory with others.</p>
